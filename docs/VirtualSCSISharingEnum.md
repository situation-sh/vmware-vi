# VirtualSCSISharingEnum

Sharing describes three possible ways of sharing the SCSI bus: One of these values is assigned to the sharedBus object to determine if or how the SCSI bus is shared.  Possible values: - `noSharing`: The virtual SCSI bus is not shared. - `virtualSharing`: The virtual SCSI bus is shared between two or more virtual machines.      In this case, no physical machine is involved. - `physicalSharing`: The virtual SCSI bus is shared between two or more virtual machines   residing on different physical hosts.
