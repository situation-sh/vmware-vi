# ObjectUpdateKindEnum

Enumeration of different kinds of updates.  Possible values: - `modify`: A property of the managed object changed its value. - `enter`: A managed object became visible to a filter for the first time.      For instance, this can happen if a virtual machine is added to a   folder. - `leave`: A managed object left the set of objects visible to a filter.      For   instance, this can happen when a virtual machine is destroyed.
