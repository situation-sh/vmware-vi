# VirtualAppVAppStateEnum

The VAppState type defines the set of states a vApp can be in.  The transitory states between started and stopped is modeled explicitly, since the starting or stopping of a vApp is typically a time-consuming process that might take minutes to complete.  Possible values: - `started`: The vApp is currently powered on . - `stopped`: The vApp is currently powered off or suspended. - `starting`: The vApp is in the process of starting. - `stopping`: The vApp is in the process of stopping.    ***Since:*** vSphere API 4.0
