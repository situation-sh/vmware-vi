# CustomizationPrefixName

Specifies that a unique name should be generated by concatenating the base string with a number.  Virtual machine names are unique across the set of hosts and virtual machines known to the VirtualCenter instance. VirtualCenter tracks the network names of virtual machines as well as hosts. VMware Tools runs in a guest operating system and reports information to VirtualCenter, including the network name of the guest. 

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes

**base** | **str** | Base prefix, to which a unique number is appended.  | 

## Example

```python
from vmware_vi.models.customization_prefix_name import CustomizationPrefixName

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of CustomizationPrefixName from a JSON string
customization_prefix_name_instance = CustomizationPrefixName.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print CustomizationPrefixName.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
customization_prefix_name_dict = customization_prefix_name_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of CustomizationPrefixName from a dict
customization_prefix_name_form_dict = customization_prefix_name.from_dict(customization_prefix_name_dict)
