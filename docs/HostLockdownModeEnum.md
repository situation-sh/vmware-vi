# HostLockdownModeEnum

Defines the possible states of lockdown mode.  Possible values: - `lockdownDisabled`: Indicates that lockdown mode is disabled. - `lockdownNormal`: Indicates that lockdown mode is enabled with service DCUI   (Direct Console User Interface) running. - `lockdownStrict`: Indicates that lockdown mode is enabled with service DCUI stopped.
