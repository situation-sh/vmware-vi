# TooManyConsecutiveOverrides

Thrown if there are too many consecutive user overrides of server-managed settings.  There are some properties which users are allowed to set only in certain configurations. The system controls them in other configurations, and overrides all user updates. If there are such frequent user overrides in the system controlled state that the next update arrives before the previous override is complete, the system can enter a tight loop and appear unresponsive to the user. This would typically happen if the user overrides are generated by a script. If the number of such user overrides exceeds the supported maximum, we conceptually \"throw\" this fault. In practice, this is converted into a host-level ConfigIssue in VC.  ***Since:*** VI API 2.5

## Example

```python
from vmware_vi.models.too_many_consecutive_overrides import TooManyConsecutiveOverrides

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of TooManyConsecutiveOverrides from a JSON string
too_many_consecutive_overrides_instance = TooManyConsecutiveOverrides.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print TooManyConsecutiveOverrides.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
too_many_consecutive_overrides_dict = too_many_consecutive_overrides_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of TooManyConsecutiveOverrides from a dict
too_many_consecutive_overrides_form_dict = too_many_consecutive_overrides.from_dict(too_many_consecutive_overrides_dict)
