    This specifies how an IP address was obtained for a given interface.  See RFC 4293 IpAddressOriginTC.  Possible values: - `other`: Any other type of address configuration other than the below   mentioned ones will fall under this category.      For e.g., automatic   address configuration for the link local address falls under   this type. - `manual`: The address is configured manually.      The term 'static' is a synonym. - `dhcp`: The address is configured through dhcp. - `linklayer`: The address is obtained through stateless autoconfiguration (autoconf).      See RFC 4862, IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration. - `random`: The address is chosen by the system at random   e.g., an IPv4 address within 169.254/16, or an RFC 3041 privacy address.    ***Since:*** vSphere API 4.1
