    The list of known disk modes.  The list of supported disk modes varies by the backing type. The \"persistent\" mode is supported by every backing type.  Possible values: - `persistent`: Changes are immediately and permanently written to the virtual disk. - `nonpersistent`: Changes to virtual disk are made to a redo log and discarded at power off. - `undoable`: Changes are made to a redo log, but you are given the option to commit or undo. - `independent_persistent`: Same as persistent, but not affected by snapshots. - `independent_nonpersistent`: Same as nonpersistent, but not affected by snapshots. - `append`: Changes are appended to the redo log; you revoke changes by removing the undo log.
