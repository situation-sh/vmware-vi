    The product spec operation types.  Possible values: - `preInstall`: Push the switch's host component of the specified product info to the   host members of the switch at a fixed location known by the host. - `upgrade`: Change the switch implementation to use the specified one.      If the   property values in the specified product info are different from   those of the corresponding properties in the switch's product info,   a host component preinstall and switch upgrade will be performed. - `notifyAvailableUpgrade`: Set the product information for an available switch upgrade that   would be done by the switch implementation.      This operation will post   a config issue on the switch to signal the availability of an upgrade.   This operation is applicable only in the case when switch policy   *DVSPolicy.autoUpgradeAllowed*   is set to false. - `proceedWithUpgrade`: If productSpec is set to be same as that in the   *DvsUpgradeAvailableEvent* configIssue, the switch   implementation will proceed with the upgrade.      To reject or stop the   upgrade, leave the productSpec unset. If productSpec is set but does not   match that in *DvsUpgradeAvailableEvent* configIssue,   a fault will be raised.   This operation is applicable only in the case when switch policy   *DVSPolicy.autoUpgradeAllowed*   is set to false. - `updateBundleInfo`: Update the bundle URL and ID information.      If other properties in   the specified product info differ from the   corresponding properties of the switch's product info, a fault will   be thrown. Updating the bundle ID will result in installing the new host   component identified by the bundle ID.  ***Since:*** vSphere API 4.0
