For e.g., automatic   address configuration for the link local address falls under   this type. - `manual`: The address is configured manually. - `dhcp`: The address is configured through dhcp. - `linklayer`: The address is obtained through stateless autoconfiguration. - `random`: The address is chosen by the system at random   e.g., an IPv4 address within 169.254/16, or an RFC   3041 privacy address.    ***Since:*** vSphere API 4.0
