    Defines a host's connection state.  Possible values: - `connected`: Connected to the server.      For ESX Server, this is always the setting. - `notResponding`: VirtualCenter is not receiving heartbeats from the server.      The state   automatically changes to connected once heartbeats are received   again. This state is typically used to trigger an alarm on the host. - `disconnected`: The user has explicitly taken the host down.      VirtualCenter does not expect to   receive heartbeats from the host. The next time a heartbeat is received, the   host is moved to the connected state again and an event is logged.
